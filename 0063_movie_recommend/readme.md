# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System (MovieLens 100K)

This project builds a movie recommendation system based on the MovieLens 100K dataset using collaborative filtering techniques implemented via the `fastai` library. It demonstrates model development, evaluation, and deployment through a web-based Gradio demo hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

## üß† Models & Techniques

- **Dataset**: [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)  
  (943 users, 1682 movies, 100K ratings)

- **Collaborative Filtering Architectures**:
  - `DotProduct`: vanilla dot-product-based embedding model
  - `DotProduct + y_range`: adds output clipping for score stability
  - `DotProduct + bias`: includes user/item bias terms
  - `nn.Parameter`-based Embedding: manual implementation of latent matrices
  - `CollabNN`: shallow MLP with non-linear interaction
  - `Deep CollabNN`: 2-hidden-layer MLP with dropout and weight decay

- **Tools & Frameworks**:
  - `fastai.collab` (for efficient model prototyping)
  - `PyTorch` (as backend)
  - `Gradio` (for live model serving)
  - `Hugging Face Spaces` (for public web demo)

## üöÄ How to Run

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Local Execution 

1. **Setup environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n fastai python=3.11
   conda activate fastai
   pip install -U fastai gradio pandas torch

2.	Run the app
```bash
python app.py

```
3.	Launch the interface -> Gradio will provide a localhost URL where you can test the model interactively.

## üåê How to Deploy in Hugging Face Spaces
1.	Upload the following files to your Space:

- app.py: main Gradio script
- export.pkl: fastai-trained model file
- ratings.csv: dataset with user id, movie id, and title
- requirements.txt: specify compatible dependencies
	
 3.	Space Runtime:
Select Gradio (Python) as the app type.
	
 4.	Note on Compatibility:
	‚Ä¢	The exported model relies on fastai<2.8.0 due to deprecation of fastcore.transform.
Include this in your requirements.txt:
```bash
fastai==2.7.12
```

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions

| Issue | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| ‚ùå `httpcore` module not found | Occurred due to partial installation of Gradio dependencies | Installed with `pip install -U "gradio[all]"` |
| ‚ùå `load_learner` fails on HF Spaces | FastAI model depended on deprecated `fastcore.transform` | Fixed by pinning `fastai==2.7.12` |
| ‚ùå `IndexError` during inference | User/item IDs were mapped incorrectly | Used `.dls.classes['user id'].o2i` for correct embedding lookup |
| üîÅ MPS vs CPU prediction inconsistency | Local training used Apple MPS (GPU), inference ran on CPU | Ensured ID mapping and data processing consistency across environments |
