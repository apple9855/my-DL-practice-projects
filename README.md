# my-DL-practice-projects
This repository showcases a collection of my practical deep learning projects, developed as part of my self-driven journey into the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. With a background in accounting/audit/finance and a passion for data science, I transitioned into AI by learning through online resources, courses, and hands-on projects.

## **What’s inside**:

This repo is like a treasure chest of my learning adventures — from deep diving into reinforcement learning 🏊‍♀️ to playing with generative models 🤖. While I started as an accounting nerd, I soon realized the real magic happens when you let AI run wild. Every project here is a fun experiment, a challenge, or simply me trying to teach AI how to recognize cats 🐱 and generate cool images 🎨.

## **Why I’m here**:

Just trying to become an AI wizard, one project at a time 🧙‍♂️. Some of my projects are experiments that worked, some… well, not so much (we all have our fair share of *“oops”* moments, right? 😅). But the real goal here is to build a strong portfolio for future AI jobs, so if you’re an employer checking this out… I promise it’s been fun, and I’m ready for more challenges!
